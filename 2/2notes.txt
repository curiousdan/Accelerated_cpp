2: Looping and Counting.

2.1: The problem.
Remember the problem in 1.2, where given a name, the program would write out a greeting with a frame around it. Currently, a change to the output format requires rewriting the program. We want flexibility without having to store each line in a local variable. We approach problem by generating each character in the output separately, except in greeting itself, which is available as a string.

2.2 Overall Structure
We'll keep the part that asks for name, the part that reads in from console, and the greeting message "Hello" + name + "!". But we will rewrite the part around the frame.

2.3 writing an unknown number of rows.

Think of output as rectangular array. Greeting takes up one row, as do top and bottom rows of the frame (3 rows). We need # of blank rows between greeting and frame. We double this number and add 3 to get the total number of rows in the output.
